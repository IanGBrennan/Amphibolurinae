# Alignment Files

This project included a fine-scale look at the molecular phylogenetics of agamid lizards. We provide multiple sequence alignment files for datasets focusing on all samples, a genus-level look at the Amphibolurinae, and a subfamily look at the Agamidae. Each zipped directory of alignments is accompanied by a zipped directory of locus trees estimated from those alignments. 

**Agamidae_Species_Alignments.zip**/**..._GeneTrees.zip**: fully sampled alignments of all samples.

**Agamidae_Subfamily_Alignments.zip**/**..._GeneTrees.zip**: subfamily alignments to look at the broader relationships among agamid groups.

**Amphibolurinae_Genera_Alignments**/**..._GeneTrees.zip**: genus level alignments of amphibolurines.
