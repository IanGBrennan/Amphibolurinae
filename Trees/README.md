# Trees

Phylogenetic trees of dragon lizards. There are a number of different trees in this directory with different sampling. These were used for different purposes outlined below:

**Agamidae_Species_ASTRAL4.tre**: fully sampled species tree estimated using ASTRAL IV

**Agamidae_Species_hASTRAL.tre**: fully sampled species tree estimated using hASTRAL

**Agamidae_Subfamilies_AllLoci_hASTRAL.tre**: reduced sampling to investigate relationships among agamid subfamilies. Includes all loci (UCE, AHE, genes).

**Agamidae_Subfamilies_UCE_hASTRAL.tre**: reduced sampling to investigate relationships among agamid subfamlies. Estimated from UCEs only.

**Amphibolurinae_forR.tre**: timetree for use in analyses, with slightly reduced sampling due to lack of morphological data for C.tjantjalka, C.modestus, C.ibiri, C.kartiwarru, D.ameliae, T.mccartneyi, T.osbornei

**Amphibolurinae_Genera_hASTRAL.tre**: genus-level tree of amphibolurines estiamted with hASTRAL. 

**Amphibolurinae_MCMCTree_RegNo.tre**: timetree including registration numbers for each sample

**Amphibolurinae_MCMCTree.tre**: timetree including just genus and species for each sample
